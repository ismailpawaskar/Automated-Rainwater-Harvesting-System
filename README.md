# Automated Rainwater Harvesting System

## Project Overview
The Automated Rainwater Harvesting System is designed to efficiently manage the collection and storage of rainwater using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system utilizes various sensors to detect the water level in the tank and automates the flow of water to prevent overflow. It replicates the actual water flow in an apartment or building, eliminating the need for human intervention to control the pumps. The tank's water level is monitored and updated on a mobile device via Blynk, a cloud application.

## Features
- **Automated Water Level Detection**: Uses sensors to detect and monitor the water level in the tank.
- **Overflow Prevention**: Automatically controls the flow of water to prevent the tank from overflowing.
- **Automated Pump Control**: Manages the operation of pumps to fill the tank and distribute water.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Updates and monitors the water level on a mobile device using the Blynk cloud application.
- **Human Intervention Elimination**: Reduces the need for manual control of the water system, increasing efficiency and reliability.

## How It Works

### System Overview
The Automated Rainwater Harvesting System operates by integrating various IoT components and sensors to automate the collection and management of rainwater. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:

1. **Water Level Detection**:
    - Sensors placed in the water tank continuously monitor the water level.
    - The sensors send real-time data to the central control system.

2. **Overflow Prevention**:
    - When the water level reaches a predefined threshold, the system automatically stops the inflow of water to prevent overflow.
    - This is achieved by controlling the operation of the inlet valve or pump.

3. **Pump Automation**:
    - The system controls the pumps to transfer water from the collection area to the storage tank.
    - If the tank’s water level is low, the system activates the pump to fill the tank.
    - If the tank is full, the pump is turned off to prevent overflow.

4. **Real-time Monitoring and Control**:
    - The water level and system status are updated in real-time on a mobile device using the Blynk application.
    - Users can monitor the tank’s water level and system operations from anywhere with an internet connection.

5. **Mobile Notifications**:
    - The system sends notifications to the user’s mobile device about the water level and any actions taken (e.g., pump activation, overflow prevention).

### Example Workflow
Here’s an example of how the system operates from start to finish:

1. **Water Collection**:
    - Rainwater is collected and directed into the storage tank.
    - Sensors in the tank monitor the water level.

2. **Sensor Data Transmission**:
    - The sensors transmit the water level data to the central control unit.

3. **Pump Control**:
    - If the water level is below the threshold, the control unit activates the pump to add water.
    - If the water level is at or above the threshold, the control unit deactivates the pump to prevent overflow.

4. **Real-time Updates**:
    - The current water level and system status are sent to the Blynk cloud application.
    - Users receive real-time updates and can check the status on their mobile devices.

5. **Notification Alerts**:
    - Users are notified on their mobile devices when the water level is low, when the pump is activated, or if there is a risk of overflow.

### Components Used
- **Sensors**: For detecting water levels in the tank.
- **Microcontroller**: For processing sensor data and controlling the system.
- **Pumps and Valves**: For managing water flow.
- **Blynk Application**: For real-time monitoring and notifications.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: For updating the system status and sending notifications to mobile devices.

2. Connect the sensors and microcontroller according to the provided schematics.
3. Install the Blynk application on your mobile device and set up the cloud connection.
4. Upload the code to the microcontroller.
5. Run the system and monitor the water level via the Blynk application.

## Usage
1. Monitor the water level in the tank through the Blynk application.
2. Receive notifications on your mobile device about the system status.
3. Ensure the system components are functioning correctly.


## How It Works

### System Overview
The Automated Rainwater Harvesting System is designed to efficiently manage the collection and storage of rainwater using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system employs various sensors and actuators to automate the process and provide real-time updates to the user. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the system functions:

1. **Sensor Integration**:
    - **Water Level Sensors**: These sensors are placed in the tank to continuously monitor the water level. They provide real-time data on how full the tank is.
    - **Overflow Prevention Sensors**: Additional sensors are used to detect when the tank is nearing its full capacity to prevent overflow.

2. **Data Transmission**:
    - The data collected by the sensors is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller (such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi) which processes the information and makes decisions based on predefined rules.

3. **Automated Water Flow Control**:
    - **Pump Activation**: When the water level in the tank reaches a certain threshold, the system automatically activates pumps to either:
        - Fill the tank if it’s empty.
        - Stop pumping if the tank is full to prevent overflow.
    - **Water Distribution**: The system also manages the distribution of water from the tank to various outlets (such as faucets or irrigation systems) as needed.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - **Blynk Integration**: The system is integrated with Blynk, a cloud-based application, which allows real-time monitoring of the water level. Users can see the current water level and receive notifications on their mobile devices.
    - **Alerts**: The system sends alerts to the user’s mobile device when:
        - The tank is full and overflow is imminent.
        - The water level is low and the tank needs refilling.
        - Any other critical event that requires user attention.

5. **User Interface**:
    - **Mobile App**: Through the Blynk app, users can monitor the system’s status, check water levels, and receive notifications. The app provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the system.
    - **Manual Override**: In case of emergencies or maintenance, users can manually control the pumps via the app.
